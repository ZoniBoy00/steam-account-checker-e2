## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Inventory Access Problems:**
- **"Temporarily unavailable"**: Steam servers may be busy, try again later
- **"Steam Web API access issue"**: API key may lack inventory permissions
- **"Access restricted"**: Steam experiencing high traffic, wait and retry
- **"Private inventory"**: Correctly detected, cannot be accessed

**API Key Issues:**
- **"Invalid API key"**: Verify key is correct and active
- **"Access denied"**: API key may lack necessary permissions
- **"Rate limited"**: Wait before making more requests

**General Issues:**
- **File upload not working**: Ensure file is .txt/.csv/.log format under 5MB
- **Tokens not parsing**: Check format matches expected patterns
- **Mobile display issues**: Clear browser cache and reload

### Performance Tips
- Use Steam authentication for better inventory access
- Wait between large batch checks to avoid rate limits
- Keep API key secure and don't share it
- Use file upload for large token lists

## üîí Security & Privacy

- **Local Processing**: All data processed locally in your browser
- **No Data Storage**: No tokens or account data stored on external servers
- **Encrypted API Keys**: API keys encrypted before localStorage storage
- **Official APIs**: Only communicates with official Steam servers
- **Steam Authentication**: Uses official Steam OpenID protocol
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse with intelligent rate limiting
